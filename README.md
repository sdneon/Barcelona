## Dev Notes
TODO: Need larger font for hour digits! Unfortunately, Pebble only supports up to font size ~48. Tried size 70 and the lower half of digits are frayed and cut off.

## Credits
Thanks to:
* Ariq Sya for his [Lemon/Milk font](http://www.dafont.com/lemon-milk.font?fpp=10&psize=l&text=1234567890), which I'm using as a stand-in until I find a simple means to draw a larger digit in a hollow style, somewhat similar to Lemon/Milk.

## Changelog
* v1.0 (work-in-progress)
  * Initial beta.
