[Barcelona football club](http://www.fcbarcelona.com/club/) inspired watch face for Pebble Time. (Colour, Digital).


## Display
Watch face looks similar to Barcelona's crest.
1. Barça colours creeps up to indicate the minutes. Hours displayed in numerals.
2. A little 'P' in the top right corner indicates it's PM.
3. Battery-level indicator:
   * white card outline: charging,
   * yellow card: not more than 20% charge remaining,
   * red card: not more than 10% charge remaining.
4. Bluetooth connection indicator:

## Dev Notes
TODO: Need larger font for hour digits! Unfortunately, Pebble only supports up to font size ~48. Tried size 70 and the lower half of digits are frayed and cut off.

## Credits
Thanks to:
* [Ariq Sya](http://www.dafont.com/lemon-milk.font?fpp=10&psize=l&text=1234567890) for his Lemon/Milk font, which I'm using as a stand-in until I find a simple means to draw a larger digit in a hollow style, somewhat similar to Lemon/Milk.

## Changelog
* v1.0 (work-in-progress)
  * Initial beta.
